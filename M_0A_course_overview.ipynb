    "\n",
    "This course introduces the student to neural networks, regularization units (ReLU), convolution neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Deep learning allows a model to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is similar to the function of the human brain. The focus of this course is primarily upon the application of deep learning, with some introduction to the mathematical foundations of deep learning. Students make use of the Python programming language to architect a deep learning model for several real-world data sets and interpret the results of these networks."
